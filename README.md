# Requests Builder


Request builder tool for creating [Process API](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/#/API/) Requests. This tool is meant for internal usage, so expect design flaws and probably some bugs.


### Supported features (13/07/2020):


  - Create a Process API Request and see on real-time the curl command generated.
  - Select a bounding box or polygon with two different CRS (EPSG:3857 or EPSG:4326)
  - See the response on the request and download it (the response opens a pop-up, beware on blocking them!)
  - Parse a request to see the form filled automatically (curl commands generated by the tool and the JSON body of the request are supported)
  - Create and track Batch Requests
  - Create TPDI Requests using Airbus or PHR data.
  - Create WMS (OGC) requests
  - Output SH-PY/SH-JS code on the request preview (PROCESS)
  - Support to Data Fusion
  - Create BYOC requests.
